# Grapes

Disposable Kubernetes Cluster Factory

## Why?

As a Kubernetes Engineer I sometimes just need a Kubernetes environment that I can tinker with. [banana-bread](https://github.com/alleaffengaffen/banana-bread) is already such a disposable EKS cluster that was used heavily in the last couple of months. But grapes is different in that it supports multiple distributions, not only EKS.
